# machine-learning-playgrounds
This is a repository for understanding basics of machine learning, including models and methods. Each topic is experimented and visualised using a jupyter notebook.

The library is mainly developed during my studying comp90049\_2025\_sm1 from the university of melbourne.

Contributions are welcomed.
